#### Description:
The JavaIsland website is a website that displays the beauty of Java Island. There are many interesting features there, including learning about Javanese culture, traditional foods and traditional events. This website also has AI that can help answer questions from users.

I created this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technology. It took me a very long time to create this website completely and complexly

The first step when I created this project was to think of an idea, I had to see what interesting ideas I could implement in this final project

The next step is to create a project concept, starting from design, etc.

The last step is to execute the website, I use Visual Studio Code to create this website using technology such as HTML, CSS, etc.
